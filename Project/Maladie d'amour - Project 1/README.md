La tempête
Lucien Cusson-Fradet

The program is part animation, part game.

KEYBOARD CONTROLS are displayed on the game screen but, if it's a bit confusing, here they are:
- SPACEBAR: Jump / Deploy Parachute / Hide Parachute / Triggers the Bird
- SHIFT: Shifts gears of the car (Between Drive and Reverse)
- W: Gas pedal
- S: Break pedal
- BACKSPACE: secret key, allows to skip the game and witness the ending.

!!!DISCLAIMER!!! The characters in the game are voiced and use offensive québécois swear words! !!!DISCLAIMER!!!
